	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>This website was created to show off my personal projects, and to gain experience with things I have never used before. This was made entirely with html, css, and in some pages, javascript. Enjoy!</p>
	<p>This is a page that was mostly made to make use of the navigation bar, so it wasn't just two options.</p>
